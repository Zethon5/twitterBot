This is a simple twitter bot script using tweepy that when run will just respond to anyone that '@'s the bot and says something 
like 'hi' or 'how are you'. This bot will also like the users tweet. 

I could only get this to work by running it on PythonAnywhere.com using their $ BASH console. Unfortunately this won't 
work properly with python 3.7. (works fine with python 3.6) Using a PythonAnywhere.com free account I am also able to keep the 
bot running for extended amounts of time without needing the program to run on my computer at all. 

I got a lot of help from Youtube.com -> CS Dojo.

This project was my first project using the tweepy library and was more to get familiar with the tweepy library.
Using CS Dojo's code, I mainly tried to just build a bot more for my preferences, and can now likely start to create
other tweepy bots on my own.
